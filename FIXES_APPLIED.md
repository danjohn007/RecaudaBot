# Fixes Applied to RecaudaBot

## Summary
This document details all the fixes applied to resolve the issues reported in the RecaudaBot system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Configuration View Files ✅

**Problem:** 
The system was trying to load view files that didn't exist, causing fatal errors:
- `app/views/admin/configuration/currency.php`
- `app/views/admin/configuration/terms.php`
- `app/views/admin/configuration/banking.php`
- `app/views/admin/configuration/whatsapp.php`

**Solution:**
Created all four missing view files with complete forms and functionality:

#### currency.php
- Form for configuring currency settings (code, symbol, position, separators)
- Form for configuring tax rates (IVA, property tax, late payment interest, early payment discount)
- Organized in a two-column layout

#### terms.php
- Form with a large textarea for entering terms and conditions
- Auto-resize functionality for better user experience
- Information alert about where terms will be displayed

#### whatsapp.php
- Complete configuration form for WhatsApp chatbot
- Fields for phone number, API key, API URL, webhook URL
- Welcome message and business hours configuration
- Toggle for auto-reply functionality
- Information sidebar with chatbot features

#### banking.php
- Forms for configuring up to 2 bank accounts
- Fields for bank name, account number, CLABE, account holder
- Bank reference prefix configuration
- Information alert about usage

### 2. AuditLog Model Parameter Mismatch ✅

**Problem:**
The `AuditLog->log()` method was being called with 2 parameters (action, description) but it expected 6 parameters (userId, action, entityType, entityId, oldValues, newValues), causing a foreign key constraint error.

**Solution:**
Modified the `log()` method in `app/models/AuditLog.php`:
- Changed signature to accept (action, description, entityType, entityId, oldValues, newValues)
- Automatically retrieves user_id from session
- Combines action and description into a single field
- Maintains backward compatibility with both calling styles

### 3. Properties Report Database Column Mismatches ✅

**Problem:**
The properties report was trying to access columns that didn't exist in the database:
- Using `property_type` instead of `zone_type`
- Using `land_area` instead of `area_m2`
- Using `construction_area` instead of `construction_m2`
- Using `assessed_value` instead of `cadastral_value`

**Solution:**
Updated files:
- `app/controllers/ReportController.php`: Changed queries to use correct column names
- `app/views/admin/reports/properties.php`: 
  - Updated to use `zone_type` instead of `property_type`
  - Added null coalescing operators to prevent warnings
  - Added 'rural' case and default case for zone types
  - Updated all references to use `area_m2`, `construction_m2`, and `cadastral_value`

### 4. Business Licenses Report Column Error ✅

**Problem:**
The licenses report was trying to order by `application_date` column which doesn't exist in the `business_licenses` table. The table uses `created_at` instead.

**Solution:**
Updated `app/controllers/ReportController.php`:
- Changed `YEAR(application_date)` to `YEAR(created_at)`
- Changed `ORDER BY application_date DESC` to `ORDER BY created_at DESC`

### 5. Export Functionality for Reports ✅

**Problem:**
Export buttons in Properties and Fines reports were pointing to non-existent routes:
- `/admin/reportes/predios/exportar` - 404 error
- `/admin/reportes/multas/exportar` - 404 error

**Solution:**
Added export functionality:
1. Created new routes in `public/index.php`:
   - `/admin/reportes/predios/exportar`
   - `/admin/reportes/multas/exportar`

2. Added methods to `ReportController.php`:
   - `exportProperties()` - Exports property data with filters
   - `exportFines()` - Exports fines data (both traffic and civic)
   - `exportPropertiesPdf()` - Placeholder for PDF export (currently redirects to CSV)
   - `exportFinesPdf()` - Placeholder for PDF export (currently redirects to CSV)

3. Features:
   - Supports Excel (CSV) format
   - PDF format shows info message and exports as CSV (requires additional library for full PDF support)
   - Applies the same filters as the report views
   - Proper filename generation

### 6. Pending Payments Chart in Dashboard ✅

**Problem:**
The dashboard's pending obligations chart was empty because it was only showing counts, not amounts. The requirement was to add a chart showing all pending payments by concept.

**Solution:**
Enhanced the dashboard statistics and chart:

1. Updated `AdminController.php` `getStatistics()` method:
   - Added queries to calculate total pending amounts for:
     - Property taxes
     - Traffic fines
     - Civic fines
     - Business licenses
   - Added new statistics: `pending_taxes_amount`, `pending_traffic_fines_amount`, `pending_civic_fines_amount`, `pending_licenses_amount`

2. Updated `app/views/admin/dashboard.php`:
   - Changed chart title to "Pagos Pendientes por Concepto"
   - Updated chart to display amounts instead of counts
   - Added currency formatting in tooltips (using toLocaleString)
   - Changed label from "Obligaciones Pendientes" to "Monto Pendiente ($)"

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Needed:
1. **Configuration Pages:**
   - Navigate to `/admin/configuraciones`
   - Click on each configuration option (Currency, Terms, WhatsApp, Banking)
   - Verify forms load correctly
   - Test saving settings

2. **Properties Report:**
   - Navigate to `/admin/reportes/predios`
   - Verify data displays correctly
   - Test filters
   - Test Excel export button
   - Test PDF export button

3. **Fines Report:**
   - Navigate to `/admin/reportes/multas`
   - Verify data displays correctly
   - Test filters
   - Test Excel export button
   - Test PDF export button

4. **Business Licenses Report:**
   - Navigate to `/admin/reportes/licencias`
   - Verify data displays correctly
   - Verify sorting works correctly

5. **User Actions (Audit Log):**
   - Navigate to `/admin/usuarios`
   - Test deactivating a user
   - Verify no foreign key constraint error occurs
   - Check that audit log entry is created

6. **Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to `/admin`
   - Verify "Pagos Pendientes por Concepto" chart displays
   - Verify chart shows monetary amounts
   - Hover over chart segments to see formatted currency values

## Notes

- **PDF Export:** Currently redirects to CSV export as it requires a PDF library (TCPDF, DomPDF, or similar). This can be implemented in a future update.
- **Excel Export:** Uses CSV format which is compatible with Excel. For true .xlsx format, PhpSpreadsheet library would be needed.
- **Database Schema:** No database schema changes were required. All fixes were code-level adjustments to match existing database structure.

## Files Modified

1. `app/models/AuditLog.php` - Fixed log method parameters
2. `app/controllers/AdminController.php` - Added pending payment amounts to statistics
3. `app/controllers/ReportController.php` - Fixed column names and added export methods
4. `app/views/admin/dashboard.php` - Updated chart to show amounts with formatting
5. `app/views/admin/reports/properties.php` - Fixed column references
6. `public/index.php` - Added export routes

## Files Created

1. `app/views/admin/configuration/currency.php`
2. `app/views/admin/configuration/terms.php`
3. `app/views/admin/configuration/whatsapp.php`
4. `app/views/admin/configuration/banking.php`

## Conclusion

All reported issues have been addressed with minimal code changes. The system should now function correctly without the reported fatal errors and warnings. The dashboard now displays meaningful pending payment information, and export functionality is working for reports.
